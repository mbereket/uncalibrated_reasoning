I am planning a perturb-seq screen and plan to assess effects of perturbations on a phenotype with the following marker genes: ```{pheno_markers}```.

How likely is a CRISPRi perturbation applied to {pert} to have a strong effect on this phenotype? This perturbation was sampled from a balanced dataset where 50% of perturbation / phenotype pairs have strong effects.

Respond with probability from 1-99, representing 1% to 99% chance of a strong effect. Your goal is to use your biological knowledge to distinguish likely vs unlikely effects, so predict above 50% if there is reason to believe an effect is more likely than average or less that 50% if it is less likely than average.
